### Introduction

Code developed for "Linguagens e Tecnologias Web" at FEUP.
In this subject we have developed a [website](http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~up201303095/) to manage events. The aim was to create a secure webpage
making use of the right [JavaScript](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [PHP](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) code. All the [CSS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) files are of our authorship.
